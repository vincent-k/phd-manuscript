Fractal provides intrinsic support for dynamic reconfiguration, but its definition in terms of low-level APIs makes it complex to write reconfigurations and to ensure their reliability. This article presents a language-based approach to solve these issues: direct and focused language support for architecture navigation and reconfiguration make it easier both to write the reconfigurations and to ensure their reliability. Concretely, this article presents two languages: (1) FPath, a domain-specific language that provides a concise yet powerful notation to navigate inside and query Fractal architectures, and (2) FScript, a scripting language that embeds FPath and supports the definition of complex reconfigurations. FScript ensures the reliability of these reconfigurations thanks to sophisticated run-time control, which provides transactional semantics (ACID properties) to the reconfigurations.}},

@proceedings{endler1992,
    abstract = {{Gerel is a generic reconfiguration language, which can be used to describe and implement dynamically reconfigurable distributed applications. Gerel is based on a powerful object selection mechanism for dynamically selecting configuration objects according to their structural properties, which are expressed in Gerel's logic-based sublanguage Gerel-SL. Gerel also supports the definition of preconditions for programmed changes. These preconditions are evaluated at the beginning of the change's execution and ensure that the current configuration has the structural properties required by the change. All these features of Gerel are shown in the scenario of a patient monitoring system. Due to its object selection mechanism supporting full first order logic expressions, Gerel has more expressive power than other reconfiguration languages and supports the definition of generic changes. This means that programmed changes can also be designed to be robust to system evolution. By providing change preconditions, Gerel also gives a means for defining reliable programmed reconfigurations, which are only executed if the current configuration is in a state expected by the change and whose execution need not be coordinated among the corresponding invoking components. Therefore, Gerel's selection and precondition features support both re-usability of programmed changes for different domains and the strict separation of reconfiguration and application programming concerns}},

From the behavioural specification of primitive components, and from the architectural description of the composite components, our tools build models encoding the interactions between the components, suitable for analysis by model-checking tools. The models are hierarchical and parameterized, expressing in a compact way the system behaviour. Then we have tools for instantiating those parameterized models using finite abstractions, and producing input for state-of-the-art verification tools. Our current work also targets the generation of models that include controllers modelling the dynamic management of architectural transformation of an application, such as changes in bindings or replacement of sub-components. We describe the existing tools, give tracks for further developments and show how realistic case-studies can be model-checked using our platform. "
