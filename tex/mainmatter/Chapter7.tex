	This thesis discussed the application of formal methods techniques in the context of 
	component-based engineering. In particular, we focused on the \ac{GCM} and its reference 
	implementation GCM/ProActive.    	

	Our industrial case study about 
	\textsc{The HyperManager} application demonstrated the pragmatic rationale of
	formal verification by means of model-checking techniques. Indeed, the degree of automation
	offered by this approach makes it appealing for the purposes of increasing the confidence
	one can put on the properties of a verified software system. However, it is also fair to say that
	
	Moreover, it is limited to finite systems,
	
	defining finite abstractions in order to cope
	
	However, one needs to prove that these abstractions are a sound representation
