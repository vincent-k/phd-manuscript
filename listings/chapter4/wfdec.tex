  forall c, decidable (well_formed_component c).
Proof.
 fix 1; intros [i p ic cl lc li lb].
 assert (IHp_dec := 
     well_formed_component_lc_dec well_formed_component_dec lc);
 clear well_formed_component_dec.
 Guarded.

 destruct (well_formed_interfaces_dec li); 
 destruct (unique_ids_dec lc);
  
 (*The first subgoal is when all properties are Well-formed. The 
 others have at least one that isn't and are proved by congruence*)
